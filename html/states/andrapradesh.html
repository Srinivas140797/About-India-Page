                <dt> <u>About Jagan Mohan Reddy</u> :</dt> <br>
                <dd>Yeduguri Sandinti Jagan Mohan Reddy (born 21 December 1972), also known as Y. S. Jagan or mononymously Jagan, is an Indian politician currently serving as the 17th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. He is the founder and president of the Indian political party, YSR Congress Party (YSRCP). He is also the son of Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy, former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.

                    Jagan Mohan Reddy started his political career in the Indian National Congress and was elected as the Member of Parliament of Kadapa in 2009. After his father's death due to helicopter crash in 2009, he started Odarpu Yatra (a consoling tour) across the state. He then eventually came out of the Congress Party and established his own party, YSR Congress Party which also matches his father's acronym, YSR.
                    
                    In 2014 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, YSRCP won 67 seats and he became the Leader of the Opposition. Five years later, in 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, he led the party to a landslide victory in the state elections by winning 151 seats of the total 175 assembly segments.</dd>
